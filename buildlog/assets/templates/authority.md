## Example Posts

### Example 1
Most agent builders optimize tool count.

Wrong metric.

Optimize debug path length: log clarity, failure replay, and recovery speed.

Smarter agents help less than diagnosable agents.

Building this in public. Follow for more.

### Example 2
The hard part of AI agents isn't reasoning.

It's deterministic fallback behavior.

If your "smart" step fails, do users still get value?

Reliability beats flash every time.

### Example 3
A useful agent architecture test:

Can you explain the last failure in 3 sentences?

If not, your observability isn't done.

Intelligence without debuggability is demo code.
