## Example Posts

### Example 1
I used to hide failed experiments.

Now I track them like wins.

Most of my best architecture decisions came from bugs I finally documented.

Progress got faster when I stopped pretending every attempt was clean.

Can anyone relate?

### Example 2
Tried to make my workflow "more autonomous" this week.

It got less predictable.

Dialed back scope, tightened tools, and added clearer boundaries.

It now does less, but does it reliably.

Anyone else relearn this monthly?

### Example 3
I spent hours tuning prompts.

The fix was better logging.

Once I could see failure patterns, prompt changes became obvious.

Sometimes the bottleneck isn't intelligence. It's visibility.
