## Example Posts

### Example 1
Most builders think speed means shipping more.

Usually it means deciding faster.

If your architecture requires six debates per feature, velocity is already gone.

### Example 2
Everyone says add more agent tools.

Reality: remove 30% of them.

Complexity compounds failure modes faster than capability compounds value.

### Example 3
"We'll fix reliability later" is a growth blocker.

Later never arrives when support load doubles.

Production trust is the growth strategy.
